# EE219-Project2

This is the Repository of EE219 Winter 2017 Project 2 (Task f to Task j) But acutally I don't want to write down anything here.
So it's just telling you what's in here.

#### Task f: Soft Margin SVM
Well All details are in the file
> [`soft_margin_svm.py`](./soft_margin_svm.py)

And this file doesn't have a graphical output.


#### Task g: Naive Bayes Classification
> [`navie_bayes.py`](./navie_bayes.py)

> [`Roc_curve.png`](./Roc_curve.png)

#### Task h: Logistic Regression without Regularization
> [`logistic_regression_without_regularization.py`](./logistic_regression_without_regularization.py)

Cause I'd like to name the file as clear as possible and I am very likely to forget the function of the code. Hahaha.
Here is the output.
> [`Roc_curve_logit.py`](./Roc_curve_logit.py)

__The only thing to mention is that setting `C=1e5` means to set the regularization to be a small effect term.__

#### Task i: Logistic Regression with L1 Norm
> [`Roc_curve_logit_l1.py`](Roc_curve_logit_l1.py)

> [`Roc_curve_logit_l1.png`](Roc_curve_logit_l1.png)

#### Task j: Logistic Regression with L2 Norm

> [`Roc_curve_logit_l2.py`](Roc_curve_logit_l2.py)

> [`Roc_curve_logit_l2.png`](Roc_curve_logit_l2.png)

This is Pinyin: Wo de README you du.
